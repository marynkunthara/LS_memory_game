**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Maryn Kunthara

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/lavender-skillful-palm)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[N/A]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[One challenge I encountered was determining how to even get started. I don't have a lot of experience with web development languages besides some self-learning I did as a hobby, so I was nervous about being able to understand and complete the tasks. I was already on a time-crunch and I thought it might be better if I just gave up and moved onto something else. However, as I looked over the project, I was intrigued by the material; I love exploring new things and finding new hobbies (it keeps life colorful!), so when I saw how well-written the tutorial was, I felt an urge to jump in, develop a cool new skill, and get my hands dirty. I also read about how you could personalize the design of the page and the buttons and I was excited to mess with the colors and shapes. So, despite my hesitation over my skill level, I decided to work to overcome the challenge. I overcame this challenge by first reading through the entire tutorial and then reading all the supplemental material as I went through each step. I wrote some code on my own and tested it out to see what it would do and how it worked. As I progressed, I started to understand basic concepts better and I could work through the steps faster. I also tried messing around with the debug feature, print logs, and the console to get a better understanding of how the languages worked. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[How much more difficult or complex can web development get from here? This was a relatively basic game that we created but how complex does the usual work web development work get? I would love to see the inner workings of a commercial webpage and the code behind it. Additionally, if I could look through the code of professional web pages I'd like to see what other functionalities are available in these languages. 
For this game, since we already had set steps and requirements we didn't have to plan or design much. But I've seen some really aesthetically pleasing web pages; How do they visualize what design they want and how do they implement it? What does the planning process usually look like? 
What skills should I develop in web development that companies may be looking for in their new hires? ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[First off, I would like to add additional features to make the game more engaging. For example, I would increase the number of buttons, increase the speed that the clues play, and vary the amount of time the buttons need to be pressed (long vs short presses). I would also like to make the interface easier to use and more aesthetically pleasing. I would do this by changing the colors of the backgrounds, fonts, and buttons to fit within a more aesthetic color palette. I would also change the fonts to be more pleasing to the eye, make the start and stop buttons bigger, change the colored buttons to be different shapes from the start/stop buttons, and add pictures to the buttons that would appear when pressed. It would be a fun feature to have the clues play out a simple and recognizable tune by modifying the frequencies and order that they play in. I think it would be fun if we could add more actions besides button pressing, like sliding a slider, double clicking, using the arrow keys, and more (almost like a Bop-It game!). I could also make the code more maintainable or easy to read by refactoring functions, adding more of my own comments, or organzing the functions by the buttons they coresspond to.]
